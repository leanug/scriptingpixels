## Content Creator's Log, Stardate: 2024.10.21. The mission to grow a YouTube channel continues... no sign of views, but the journey goes on.

The first few weeks were tough. My first video took way longer than expected. 

I had to learn how to make thumbnails 🎨, and I didn&apos;t realize it was something that required so much time. 

The audio in my videos still sounds pretty bad, especially the first one, which is over 20 minutes long 🎧. 

Recently, for my fourth video, I learned how to clean up the audio with Audacity 🎙️. 

Now, it sounds a lot better—normalizing, reducing the echo, and boosting the volume in Kdenlive because it was too quiet. 

As comrade Anatoly Dyatlov would say: Not great, not terrible 💬.

There&apos;s still room for improvement, though.

The channel&apos;s analytics 📊 are really poor. I knew it was going to be hard, but not this hard. 

At this rate, I&apos;ll reach monetization by the time I retire 😅.

My last video about localStorage was seen by 2 people, and one of them was me 😂. 

I&apos;ll try to do better for my next video.

As many YouTubers like [@ruriohama](https://www.youtube.com/@ruriohama) say, nobody&apos;s going to watch your first videos, but I&apos;m going to keep improving and making more content 💪🎥.
